<p>In 794, the Council of Frankfurt condemned the persecution of witches, called the belief in witchcraft superstitious, and ordered the death penalty for anyone burning a supposed witch. </p><p>By the late fifteenth century, Pope Innocent VIII was blaming witches for the failing harvest in Germany and authorizing witch-hunters to deal with them. The concept of witchcraft as a specific type of heresy, a devil-worshiping cult whose members gained unnatural powers, was almost complete, and the stage was set for the witch-crazes of early modern Europe. </p><p>In between those two points, from certainty that only God could alter the material world to conviction that men and women were willingly becoming Satan’s servants on earth, lies a long theological war eventually influenced by the upswelling of Protestant ‘heresies’. 
</p><p>England, however, was different. </p><p>England had passed an Act of Parliament directed at heresy in 1401. The act “De hæretico comburendo” sentences heretics to death by burning, if they failed to recant. It was directed at the Lollards, but not specific to them: it could also have applied to anyone convicted of the heresy of witchcraft (if they didn’t have the good sense to abjure Satan and all his works). </p><p> Those who caused harm by witchcraft could also be tried for that harm, but the jury system and the lack of judicial torture as regular practice in England limited convictions. Witchcraft itself — separated from the malignant effects of witchcraft or heretical beliefs — was not a crime until 1542, and statutes and Ecclesiastical Commissions of the time make it clear that the use of charms, spells and sorcery in “cures” and “specially in the time of women’s travail” were common, though frowned upon. The laws passed under Elizabeth I specifically set out the crimes of witchcraft which are punishable by law: fortune telling (predicting the monarch’s death); treasure hunting (stealing from the Crown); summoning evil spirits; and causing or attempting to cause death or injury or to provoke “unlawful” love.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&keywords=9780870237539" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&keywords=9780870237539</a> 

As a result of the combination of these factors, over three centuries, fewer than 500 people were executed for witchcraft in England, and between 200 and 300 of those by Matthew Hopkins between 1644 and 1646, when centralized law and order had become ineffective during the English Civil War. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&keywords=9780750942690" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&keywords=9780750942690</a>

It seems likely, then, that for ordinary men and women of the 15th century in England, witches were real, and potentially dangerous. Those who’d had contact with the beliefs of Continental Europe might very well have added the central elements of the witch-cult belief to their own ideas of what malignant witches might do, but not all workers of magic would be seen as automatically malicious. Many communities relied on folk-healers and midwives (of varying skill and efficacy) whose cure and aid were considered  to stem in part or whole from supernatural powers. </p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Esoteric-Codex-Witch-Hunting/dp/1312942495/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1438742313&sr=1-1&keywords=9781312942493">Council of Frankfurt</a></p><p>condemned the persecution of witches, called the belief in witchcraft superstitious, and ordered the death penalty for anyone burning a supposed witch. </p><p>By the late fifteenth century, Pope Innocent VIII was blaming witches for the failing harvest in Germany and authorizing witch-hunters to deal with them.
