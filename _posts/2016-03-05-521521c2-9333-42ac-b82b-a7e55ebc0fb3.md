Weaving elements of the classic tale of Tam Lin in a 15th century setting, _[The Black Hill][0]_ is a new twist on a classic tale of love, courage and sacrifice in the face of dark mysteries. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/46cdfcd0-a58e-44aa-8045-eda146a8314a.jpg)

When landless Sir Thomas Lynhurst returns from war, the offer of Brinday manor in the barely-subdued western counties is his only chance to escape a life of genteel poverty and dependence - even if it does come on the condition of an arranged marriage  with Crown ward Lady Modron Bryn, the only child of the recently deceased lord of Brinday Manor. 

Sent to be lord of people whose language he doesn't speak, whose customs he doesn't understand, and whose hatred of the Crown has flared to open rebellion in living memory, he turns for help to Jack Cooper, the locksmith's son whose good sense and good humor Tom grew to depend on in the King's army.

But Jack was Janet until she put on her brothers' clothes to take her father's place in the draft. Trapped in the deception, she must keep her feelings for Tom in check, but as a run of bad luck at Brinday drives the manor to the edge of disaster, she will need all her determination and ingenuity to save them both. 

And Brinday Manor holds secrets of its own. 

Janet will need more courage than ever before when the darkness at the heart of the black hill below Brinday begins to stir.
